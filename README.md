Entry for Feeding9Billion challenge at Memorial University which focuses on providing solutions that foster food security.  Our solution is a system that notifies grocery stores about expiring items so they can invite/alert food sharing communities - food banks, Salvation Army and the likes - who can then buy them at lower prices.  This way, food waste and disposal is reduced while saving costs for the grocery stores and higher purchasing power by these food sharing communities.
